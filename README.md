# wine-builder
Build different versions of wine for your system. Designed for use with qt4wine

# How to use

For now, just a default run can be achieved by issuing:

```
./build-wine.sh
```

You will be asked which wine version you wish to use (a list of the git tags).

# Wine versions
Built wine versions are deployed into WINE_BUILD_ROOT, by default `${HOME}/wine-builds`.
